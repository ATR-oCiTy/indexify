# Indexify

![Tests](https://github.com/diptanu/indexify/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)

Indexify is a knowledge and memory retrieval service for Large Language Models. It facilitates in-context learning of LLMs by providing relevant context in a prompt or exposing relevant memory to AI agents.
It also facilitates efficient execution of fine tuned/pre-trained embedding models and expose them over APIs. Several state of the art retrieval algorithms are implemented to provide a batteries-included retrieval experience.

## Why use Indexify
* **Knowledge Base for LLMs:** Real time retrieval of knowledge and context from private documents and structured data to improve accuracy of LLM models.
* **Memory Engine for Co-Pilot agents:** Store and retrieve long-term memory of agents in real-time, providing enhanced personalization and improved user experiences for co-pilot and chat based applications.
* **Real Time Data:** Data connectors keep indexes updated by syncing with source automatically wherever possible, such as a S3 bucket or a database. This enables LLMs to answer queries that require real time information about the world.
* **Secure Access:** Apply role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure your sensitive data is exposed only to the applications you choose.
* **State of the Art Embedding Models:** Support for OpenAI and state of the art embedding models from HuggingFace.
* **Custom Embedding Models:** Import and use your custom-trained or fine-tuned HuggingFace Transformer-based embedding models with ease.
