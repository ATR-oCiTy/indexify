# Welcome to Indexify

Indexify is a knowledge and memory retrieval service for Large Language Models and Generative Agents. It facilitates LLMs and Agents to respond to queries related to private data that lives in 
various private databases and documents. 
Agents can store long term memory and query them in real time to personalize co-pilot or chat based user-experience.

## Why use Indexify
* **Knowledge Base for LLMs:** Real time retreival of knowledge and context from private documents and structured data to improve accuracy of LLM models.
* **State of the Art Embedding Models:** Support for OpenAI and state of the art embedding models from Huggingface.
* **Custom Embedding Models:** Import and use your custom-trained or fine-tuned Huggingface Transformer-based embedding models with ease.
* **Memory Engine for Co-Pilot agents:** Store and retrieve long-term memory of agents in real-time, providing enhanced personalization and improved user experiences for co-pilot and chat based applications.
* **Real Time Data:** Data connectors keep indexes updated by syncing with source automatically wherever possible, such as a S3 bucket or a database. This enables LLMs to answer queries that require real time information about the world.
* **Secure Access:** Apply role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure your sensitive data is exposed only to the applications you choose.
